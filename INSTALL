SvxLink build instructions
==========================
SvxLink use the CMake build system. The basic pattern for building using CMake
looks like this:

  cd path/to/svxlink/src
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make doc
  make install

This will build SvxLink and install it under /usr/local. The first argument to
cmake point out the source directory so the build directory can be created
anywhere. A common pattern is to place the build directly under the top source
code directory, hence the ".." in the example above.

To use another install location (e.g. /opt/svxlink) use the following line when
running cmake:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/svxlink ..

The "-D" switch is used to define CMake variables. There are both standardized
CMake variables and project specific ones.

To get install locations that would be used when building a binary package,
use the following cmake line:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=/etc \
        -DLOCAL_STATE_DIR=/var ..

Cmake does normally only need to be run one time. After that the configuration
is cached so only "make" need to be run. Make will rerun cmake when necessary.

Some other good to know configuration variables that also can be set using -D
command line switch are:

  USE_ALSA          -- Set to NO to compile without Alsa sound support
  USE_OSS           -- Set to NO to compile without OSS sound support
  USE_QT            -- Set to NO to compile without Qt (no Qtel)
  BUILD_STATIC_LIBS -- Set to YES to build static libraries as well as dynamic
  LIB_SUFFIX        -- Set to 64 on 64 bit systems to install in the lib64 dir
